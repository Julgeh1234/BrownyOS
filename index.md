## BrownyOS

BrownyOS is a Linux distribution running from ubuntu with no recommended software. (Chromium is installed.)
The CLI is running with ubuntu server 18.04.6 64-bit. (You can upgrade it. Read more at 'Installation'.)
This operating system publishesd especially with an easy handling for users and a renewed design of Linux.
You can work with it as a desktop computer, but also mount this for programming.
Everybody can use it. There are no hidden programms or other files in it.
You are not allowed to sell any articles from here.
I am not going to adhere to anything in this repository.
Much fun with it!
